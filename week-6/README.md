Week 6 : 
# React Deep Dive 

Rendering: 
- react did some work to calculate what all should update in the componetn 
- the component actually got called (log to confirm)
- the inspector shows you a bounding box around the component through react extension

it happens when 
-  state varibale  that is being used in comonent changes
-  a parent component re render triggers all children re rendering ! ** IMP **
